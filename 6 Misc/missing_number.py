# Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

# Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?


# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
# Example 4:

# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
